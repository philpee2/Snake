### Rules

The aim of the game is to eat as much food as possible. Eating one piece of food earns 
one point. When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows in length, and another piece
of food is randomly placed on the screen. The game ends when the snake either 
collides with the edge of the screen, or with itself.
